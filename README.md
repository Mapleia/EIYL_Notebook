# Setup
## Recommended: Anaconda
1. [Install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html), a Python environment manager.
2. [Setup](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/r-lang/) a [R](https://www.r-project.org/) environment with conda.

    a) Follow the R Notebook tutorial up until it tells you to create a notebook in the browser.

    b) With the browser UI, navigate to where this notebook is located.
3. Install r packages through Anaconda. Open your commandline (Anaconda installation comes with one). Activate your notebook env.

```
conda install -c r r-tidyverse
conda install -c r r-lubridate
conda install -c r r-ggplot2
conda install -c r r-plotly
```
4. Edit in the browser as you please!
