    "Invasive species, like *Sargassum horneri*, are known to be able to have vast, negative effects to the ecosystems they settle in. As mentioned in the study by {cite:ts}`Small2021`, *Sargassum horneri* is an invasive species that was first reported in Long Beach Harbor, CA, USA in 2003. The researchers discuss the broader impact of the displacement of native seaweeds, since many species of macroalgae are **\"ecosystem-engineers\"** providing a foundation for the community centered around them. If their range and presense is altered by the a more **competitive dominant invasive species**, it could have consequences like reducing **species richness** among other factors that make up the ecosystem.\n",

Another study by {site:ts}`Marks2018` concludes that they occupied all hard substrate type, with a preference for medium and small boulders, which BC coast is no stranger to. \n",
